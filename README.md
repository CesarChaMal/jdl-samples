# Sample JDL files for JHipster v8

For updated JHipster v8 samples you should go to [v8 branch](https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples/tree/v8).

This repository is a showcase of JDL schema files.

Please add your own or create an issue if you'd like to see a particular one added.

Run `jhipster jdl myfile.jdl filename.jdl` just pass any file name from this repo and it will automatically be fetched. Works on JHiptser 6+
It's possible to customize the generated project by passing options `jhipster jdl default.jdl --client-framework vue --build gradle`. Run `jhipster app --help` for more choices.
